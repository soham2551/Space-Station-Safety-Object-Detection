## 🏃‍♀️ Usage / How to Run

All commands should be run from the root directory of the project.

### 1. Evaluate the Model
To evaluate our final `best.pt` model and reproduce the 80.1% mAP score, run the prediction script:
```bash
python predict.py
```
This will generate performance metrics and save predictions in the `predictions/` folder.

### 2. Train the Model from Scratch
To run the training process for 100 epochs, use the training script:
```bash
python train.py
```
Results, including model weights and graphs, will be saved to a new folder inside `runs/detect/`.

### 3. Launch the Web Application
To launch the interactive Streamlit app locally, run the following command. Your browser will open with the application.
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
